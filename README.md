# Simple Movie Recommender System

This is a Movie Recommender System build with Docker (20.10), using Python (3.6) for the recommender algorithm, Golang (1.15) for the Rest API and PHP (7.3) for the web interface. The project is a showcase of a simple web app to show how to deploy a Docker app, in which containers interact with each other, with just a few steps in every machine you want.
